# Desafio Alterdata

## About The Project

The challenge was to build a system for tickets registration. I created a home and login screens.

### Built With:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) - PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

- [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) - Knex.js is a "batteries included" SQL query builder for Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use.

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

- [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) - Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
